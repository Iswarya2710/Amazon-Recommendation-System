# Amazon-Recommendation-System
# Overview
The Amazon Recommendation System is a powerful tool designed to provide personalized product recommendations to users based on their browsing and purchasing history. This system uses advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze user behavior and suggest relevant products, enhancing the user shopping experience and increasing sales.

Recommendation systems are widely used by e-commerce platforms like Amazon to engage users, increase sales, and provide a tailored shopping experience. This project aims to build a recommendation system similar to the one used by Amazon.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook (for running example notebooks)
Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow or PyTorch (for deep learning-based recommendation), Flask (for web-based UI)
